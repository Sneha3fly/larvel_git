// Here u kind ofthing is also comming. The green "U" in VS Code does not stand for "Unix"—it stands for Untracked. This means the file is new to your project, and Git is not currently tracking its changes. The "U" will appear next to files that you have created or copied into your project, but have not yet staged (with git add) or committed.​

Key Points:
Green color: Usually signifies added or new files, and the "U" signifies "Untracked."

How to remove the "U": Stage the file with git add <filename>, which will change its status to staged and tracked.

So, "U" = "Untracked" in Git/VS Code, not "Unix" or line ending related.
