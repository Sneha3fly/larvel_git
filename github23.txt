Here's how to stage and commit changes in Git:

## Step 1: Stage Changes

**Stage a specific file:**
git add filename        or basically do git add . (this selects all)
```
**Stage all changes:**
git add .

```
or
```
git add -A
**Stage specific changes interactively:**
```
git add -p
(This lets you choose which changes to stage)

## Step 2: Commit

**Commit with a message:**
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

**Commit with a detailed message (opens editor):
git commit
```

**Combine staging and committing (for modified files only, not new files):**
git commit -am "Your commit message"
```

## Complete Example Workflow:

1. Make changes to your files
(edit file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.)

2. Check status
git status

3. Stage the changes
git add file1.txt file2.txt

4. Verify what's staged
git status

5. Commit with message
git commit -m "Add new features to file1 and file2"

6. View your commit
git log --oneline
```

## Useful Commands:

- **`git status`** - See what's changed and what's staged
- **`git diff`** - See unstaged changes
- **`git diff --staged`** - See staged changes before committing
- **`git reset filename`** - Unstage a file
- **`git restore filename`** - Discard unstaged changes

In your Laravel project, you can use these commands to track your code changes!

3. UNDER STANDING git log :-
git log is a Git command that displays the commit history of a repository. Here's what it does:

Main Functions:
 i. Shows Commit History - Displays a list of commits in reverse chronological order (newest first), including:

Commit hash (SHA-1)
Author name and email
Commit date and time
Commit message
 ii. Basic Usage:
git log 
This shows all commits with full details.

Common Options:
git log --oneline - Shows compact view with just commit hash and message
git log --graph --oneline --all - Shows branch structure visually
git log -n 5 - Shows last 5 commits
git log --author="name" - Filters commits by author
git log --since="2 weeks ago" - Shows commits from a specific time period
git log --grep="keyword" - Searches commit messages
git log filename - Shows commit history for a specific file
git log -p - Shows actual code changes (patch view)
Typical Output Example:
In short: git log lets you view and search through your project's commit history to understand what changes were made, when, and by whom.


BRANCHING -It is used to create branches and switch into them.
1. git branch
    it shows the no. of branches available for ex here it shwoed:
    * main
      sneha1
    Where ever the star is, that is the current branch we are in.
2. git branch sneha2
    it creates another branch named sneha2
3. git checkout sneha2 
    now you are in the branch sneha2 instead of main
